The first knew how to foresee the future with intelligence, although the gods did not allow him to develop it as he wanted. The second is an example of the serenity, security and prudence that, in the opinion of the man from Queron, the good politician must show in the difficulties of the homeland. Like his Greek couple, following his own criteria in the face of the irrationality of the people and other characters, he emerges with the stature of the authentic architect of the salvation of Rome before Hannibal."

Finally, in Sobre los ríos there is room for innumerable mythical legends and names of plants and stones, sometimes fictitious. These last two essays are not without their charm for a modern reader."

Other passages of their lives are also told about both, from a moral, biographical and historical point of view. The original text is accompanied by an introductory study and a complete set of notes made by two specialists in the field."

They are biographies of twelve Caesars, from Julius Caesar to Domitian."

In the ""Germania"", the only ethnographic monograph of antiquity that has been preserved and that to a great extent contributed to reaffirm the German nationality, the author confirms with evident moralizing tone the special character of this people and tries to explain why Germania still it had not been conquered. With the ""Dialogo con Oradores"", a treatise of clear Ciceronian inspiration, including the style, where the relations between political freedom and intellectual activity are analyzed, Tacito joins the debate on the decline of oratory in its final moment."

There, thanks to his ability and his friendship with Escipión Emiliano el Africano, he found the opportunity to redirect his existence. The result of this change was the writing of the monumental ""Historia de Roma"" or ""Historias"", of which only the first five books and abundant passages of the sixth have been preserved, material that is collected in this volume. Polibio broke with the historiographical tradition of his time and was guided by the innovative concept of ""pragmatic history"", characterized by focusing on contemporary history and conceiving himself as a teacher of life."
