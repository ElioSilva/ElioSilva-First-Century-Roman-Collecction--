# Reading public

## To whom are the classic Latin books addressed?

The collections that publishers have are very varied and for all types of audiences, from children to adults. For the most part, they are popular academic or scientific books that can be read by all types of public that are little known about the subject. The objective is that many opt for reading through topics of interest that can be very well used, and for this it is necessary that there is a selection of various books that can generate greater attraction and therefore increase demand.

Series such as [Clasicos de Roma y Grecia](https://www.alianzaeditorial.es/subcoleccion/biblioteca-de-clasicos-de-grecia-y-roma/) by Alianza Editorial or [Cl√°sica(Latinos)](https://www.akal.com/coleccion/clasica/) by Akal Ediciones, as has been pointed out in Advertising, contain a varied and rich collection of books by various classic authors. They are committed to the existence of the largest study for a more reliable translation, therefore, they have the most outstanding professionals and scholars in Spain. The goal is not to create books to be only sold in huge numbers, but also to be valued. A no less important reason is to preserve the works of authors, who in some cases are little known.

The objective of this collection is to establish a precedent in the history of the digital library of books in Spanish in the United States. Although there are several databases or digital projects that contain a variety of classic books or texts, it is very difficult to find a project that contains those books of great academic importance in the Spanish version.

Although the entire public can browse and read the content of this digital collection, it is important to take into account that this project is aimed at American scholars of Spanish studies, Late antiquity history, and linguistics, particularly those who have Spanish as their second language. . The idea is that it is an opportunity to reinforce your Spanish through reading classics. Finally, this can set a precedent for other digital collections whose content is literature, economics, theology, philosophy, etc. in other languages.
