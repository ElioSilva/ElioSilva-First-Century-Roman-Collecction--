## Advertising of Spanish-speaking Publishers 

Although there are several Spanish-speaking publishers that have large collections in the world, there are three highly prestigious publishers that have dedicated themselves to translating and reworking editions of Greco-Latin classics. It should be noted that these three publishers are only from Spain.

### Alianza Editorial

They are a group of intellectuals, professionals and scholars who knew how to make a collection of books from the Greco-Roman classics, through contemporary classics to current literature, along with works aimed at the academic and university world. They have always appealed to a broad spectrum of readers, offering a comprehensive yet diverse library.

### Akal Ediciones

In its fifty years of existence it has formed a catalog of more than four thousand titles organized into nearly forty collections that cover all fields of the humanities, art to politics, going through history, anthropology, philosophy, sociology or music. Added to this is the publication of classic texts (from classical Greece to the 19th century), astronomy or collections dedicated to Latin American thought, in order to promote dialogue between both sides of the Atlantic.
