## About the Collection
   This collection doesn't pretend to reinvent the wheel. It actually serves  as a useful tool for all historians and librarians who want to specialized in manuscripts and rare books, but who have  difficult access to physical books of Roman classic works, especially in Spanish. The matching of  both academic fields would contribute to the development of areas such asSpanish Studies, Spanish linguistics, Classical Latin studies, Late antiquity history and librarianship. Likewise, the elaboration of this collection help to contribute to the expansion  and variety of research sources of this particular historiographic branch. Finally, it serves  as a reference or inspiration for future scholars who want to exhibit a collection of any academic field in different languages.
